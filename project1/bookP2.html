               I  invited  him  in,  pointing to a chair.  He  paused awhile  before  speaking.  A  kind  of  gloom  emanated from him — as it does now from me. <br>
 <br>
<i>"I  sell  Bibles,"</i>  he  said.  <br>
 <br>
Somewhat pedantically, I  replied, <i>"In  this  house 
are  several  English  Bibles,  including  the  first John  Wiclif's.  I  also  have  Cipriano  de  Valera's, 
Luther's — which, from a  literary  viewpoint,  is  the 
worst — and  a  Latin  copy  of  the  Vulgate.  As  you 
see,  it's  not  exactly  Bibles  I  stand  in  need  of." </i> <br>
 <br>
After  a  few  moments  of  silence,  he  said, <i> "I  don't 
only  sell  Bibles.  I  can  show  you  a  holy  book  I  came 
across  on  the  outskirts  of  Bikaner.  It  may  interest 
you." </i> <br>
 <br>
He  opened  the  suitcase  and  laid  the  book  on  a 
table.  It  was  an  octavo  volume,  bound  in  cloth. 
There  was  no  doubt  that  it  had  passed  through 
many  hands.  Examining  it,  I  was  surprised  by  its 
unusual  weight.  On  the  spine  were  the  words 
"Holy  Writ"  and,  below  them,  "Bombay."  <br>
 <br>
<i>"Nineteenth  century,  probably,"</i>  I  remarked.  <br>
 <br>
<i>"I  don't  know,"</i>  he  said. <i> "I've  never  found  out."</i>  <br>
 <br>
I  opened  the  book  at  random.  The  script  was 
strange  to  me.  The  pages,  which  were  worn  and 
typographically  poor,  were  laid  out  in  double  columns, as  in  a  Bible.  The  text  was  closely  printed, 
and  it  was  ordered  in  versicles.  In  the  upper 
corners  of  the  pages  were  Arabic  numbers.  I  noticed that  one  left-hand  page  bore  the  number  (let 
us  say)  40,514  and  the  facing  right-hand  page  999. 
I  turned  the  leaf;  it  was  numbered  with  eight 
digits.  It  also  bore  a  small  illustration,  like  the  kind 
used  in  dictionaries — an  anchor  drawn  with  pen 
and  ink,  as  if  by  a  schoolboy's  clumsy  hand.  <br>
 <br>
It  was  at  this  point  that  the  stranger  said, <i>"Look at  the  illustration  closely.  You'll  never  see  it  again." </i>
