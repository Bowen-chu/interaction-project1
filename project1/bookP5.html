               <i> "It's  a  deal," </i> he  said. <br>
<br>
It  amazed  me  that  he  did  not  haggle.  Only  later 
was  I  to  realize  that  he  had  entered  my  house  with 
his  mind  made  up  to  sell  the  book.  Without  count- 
ing the  money,  he  put  it  away. <br>
<br>
We  talked  about  India,  about  Orkney,  and 
about  the  Norwegian  jails  who  once  ruled  it.  It 
was  night  when  the  man  left.  I  have  not  seen  him 
again,  nor  do  I  know  his  name. <br>
<br>
I  thought  of  keeping  the  Book  of  Sand  in  the 
space  left  on  the  shelf  by  the  Wiclif,  but  in  the  end 
I  decided  to  hide  it  behind  the  volumes  of  a  bro- 
ken set  of  The  Thousand  and  One  Nights.  I  went 
to  bed  and  did  not  sleep.  At  three  or  four  in  the 
morning,  I  turned  on  the  light.  I  got  down  the  im- 
possible book  and  leafed  through  its  pages.  On 
one  of  them  I  saw  engraved  a  mask.  The  upper 
corner  of  the  page  carried  a  number,  which  I  no 
longer  recall,  elevated  to  the  ninth  power. <br>
<br>
I  showed  no  one  my  treasure.  To  the  luck  of 
owning  it  was  added  the  fear  of  having  it  stolen, 
and  then  the  misgiving  that  it  might  not  truly  be 
infinite.  These  twin  preoccupations  intensified  my 
old  misanthropy.  I  had  only  a  few  friends  left;  I 
now  stopped  seeing  even  them.  A  prisoner  of  the 
book,  I  almost  never  went  out  anymore.  <br>
