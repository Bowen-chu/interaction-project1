"The  Congress"  is  perhaps  the  most  ambitious 
of  the  tales  in  this  book;  its  subject  is  that  of  an  enterprise so  vast  that  in  the  end  it  becomes  confused with  the  world  itself  and  with  the  sum  of 
daily  life.  Its  opaque  beginning  tries  to  imitate  that 
of  a  Kafka  story;  its  end  tries,  doubtless  in  vain,  to 
match  the  ecstasies  of  Chesterton  and  John  Bunyan.  I  have  never  been  worthy  of  such  a  revelation, but  I  have  managed  to  dream  one  up.  I  have 
woven  into  the  story — as  is  my  habit — a  number  of 
autobiographical  elements. <br>
<br>
Life,  which  everyone  knows  is  inscrutable,  left 
me  no  peace  until  I  perpetrated  a  posthumous 
story  by  H.  P.  Lovecraft,  a  writer  whom  I  have 
always  considered  an  unconscious  parodist  of  Poe. 
In  the  end,  I  gave  in;  the  lamentable  fruit  is  entitled "There  Are  More  Things." <br>
<br>
"The  Sect  of  the  Thirty"  salvages,  without  a 
shred  of  documentation,  the  tale  of  a  possible 
heresy. <br>
<br>
"The  Night  of  the  Gifts"  is  perhaps  the  most  innocent, most  violent,  and  most  exalted  story  offered by  this  collection. <br>
<br>
An  earlier  story  of  mine,  "The  Lottery  of  Babel" 
(1941),  imagines  an  infinite  number  of  books; 
"Undr"  and  "The  Mirror  and  the  Mask,"  centuries-old literatures  that  are  made  up  of  a  single 
line  or  word. <br>
<br>
"Utopia  of  a  Tired  Man"  is  in  my  judgment  the 
most  honest  and  melancholy  piece  in  the  collection. <br>
<br>
I  have  always  been  amazed  by  the  ethical  obsession  of  Americans.  "The  Bribe"  attempts  to  reflect 
this  trait.
