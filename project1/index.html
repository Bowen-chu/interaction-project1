                In a <a href="dream.html" class="blue-link">dream</a> as quiet as velvet, I find myself reading a leather-bound <a href="book.html" class="blue-link">book</a>. The protagonist of the <a href="book.html" class="blue-link">book</a> is also dreaming. In his <a href="dream.html" class="blue-link">dream</a>, he is trapped inside a <a href="labyrinth.html" class="blue-link">labyrinth</a>. No matter which path he takes, every turn leads him back to the beginning. The repetition persists, and his anxiety steadily grows. When panic reaches its peak, he chooses a form of escape that seems almost contradictory: he stops moving. He remains where he is, allows himself to relax, and wakes up from the reality of the <a href="book.html" class="blue-link">book</a>. At the same moment, I wake up in my own room. After waking, I open the <a href="book.html" class="blue-link">book</a> beside me and read its final paragraph. The character lifts his head from the desk and realizes—as I do—that he has finally escaped the <a href="labyrinth.html" class="blue-link">labyrinth</a>.
