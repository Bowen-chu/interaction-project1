              I  noted  my  place  and  closed  the  book.  At  once,  I 
reopened  it.  Page  by  page,  in  vain,  I  looked  for 
the  illustration  of  the  anchor. <i> "It  seems  to  be  a 
version  of  Scriptures  in  some  Indian  language,  is  it 
not?" </i> I  said  to  hide  my  dismay. <br>
 <br>
<i>"No," </i> he  replied.  Then,  as  if  confiding  a  secret, 
he  lowered  his  voice. <i> "I  acquired  the  book  in  a 
town  out  on  the  plain  in  exchange  for  a  handful  of 
rupees  and  a  Bible.  Its  owner  did  not  know  how  to 
read.  I  srspect  that  he  saw  the  Book  of  Books  as  a 
talisman.  He  was  of  the  lowest  caste;  nobody  but 
other  untouchables  could  tread  his  shadow  with- 
out contamination.  He  told  me  his  book  was  called 
the  Book  of  Sand,  because  neither  the  book  nor 
the  sand  has  any  beginning  or  end." </i> <br>
 <br>
The  stranger  asked  me  to  find  the  first  page.  <br>
 <br>
I  laid  my  left  hand  on  the  cover  and,  trying  to 
put  my  thumb  on  the  flyleaf,  I  opened  the  book.  It 
was  useless.  Every  time  I  tried,  a  number  of  pages 
came  between  the  cover  and  my  thumb.  It  was  as 
if  they  kept  growing  from  the  book.  <br>
 <br>
<i>"Now  find  the  last  page." </i> <br>
 <br>
Again  I  failed.  In  a  voice  that  was  not  mine,  I 
barely  managed  to  stammer, <i> "This  can't  be."</i>  <br>
 <br>
Still  speaking  in  a  low  voice,  the  stranger  said, 
<i>"It  can't  be,  but  it  is.  The  number  of  pages  in  this 
book  is  no  more  or  less  than  infinite.  None  is  the 
first  page,  none  the  last.  I  don't  know  why  they're 
numbered  in  this  arbitrary  way.  Perhaps  to 
suggest  that  the  terms  of  an  infinite  series  admit 
any  number."</i>  <br>
 <br>
Then,  as  if  he  were  thinking  aloud,  he  said,  <i>"If 
space  is  infinite,  we  may  be  at  any  point  in  space. 
If  time  is  infinite,  we  may  be  at  any  point  in  time." </i>
