                After studying  its  frayed  spine  and  covers  with  a  magni- 
fying glass,  I  rejected  the  possibility  of  a  contriv- 
ance of  any  sort.  The  small  illustrations,  I  verified, 
came  two  thousand  pages  apart.  I  set  about  listing 
them  alphabetically  in  a  notebook,  which  I  was  not 
long  in  filling  up.  Never  once  was  an  illustration 
repeated.  At  night,  in  the  meager  intervals  my  in- 
somnia granted,  I  dreamed  of  the  book. <br>
<br>
Summer  came  and  went,  and  I  realized  that  the 
book  was  monstrous.  What  good  did  it  do  me  to 
think  that  I,  who  looked  upon  the  volume  with  my 
eyes,  who  held  it  in  my  hands,  was  any  less  mon- 
strous? I  felt  that  the  book  was  a  nightmarish  ob- 
ject, an  obscene  thing  that  affronted  and  tainted 
reality  itself. <br>
<br>
I  thought  of  fire,  but  I  feared  that  the  burning 
of  an  infinite  book  might  likewise  prove  infinite 
and  suffocate  the  planet  with  smoke.  Somewhere  I 
recalled  reading  that  the  best  place  to  hide  a  leaf  is 
in  a  forest.  Before  retirement,  I  worked  on  Mexico 
Street,  at  the  Argentine  National  Library,  which 
contains  nine  hundred  thousand  volumes. <br>
<br>
I  knew that  to  the  right  of  the  entrance  a  curved  staircase 
leads  down  into  the  basement,  where  books  and 
maps  and  periodicals  are  kept.  One  day  I  went 
there  and,  slipping  past  a  member  of  the  staff  and 
trying  not  to  notice  at  what  height  or  distance 
from  the  door,  I  lost  the  Book  of  Sand  on  one  of 
the  basement's  musty  shelves.
