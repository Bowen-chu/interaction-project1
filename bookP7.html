Afterword <br>
<br>
Prefacing  stories  a  reader  has  not  yet  read,  since  it 
demands  the  analysis  of  plots  that  it  may  be  inconvenient to  deal  with  in  advance,  is  a  somewhat  impossible task.  I  therefore  prefer  an  afterword. <br>
<br>
The  book's  first  story  takes  up  the  old  theme  of 
the  double,  which  several  times  moved  Robert 
Louis  Stevenson's  ever-fortunate  pen.  In  England, 
its  name  is  "fetch"  or,  more  bookishly,  "wraith  of 
the  living";  in  Germany,  "Doppelganger."  One  of  its 
earliest  names,  I  suspect,  was  "alter  ego."  This 
ghostly  apparition  probably  came  from  mirrors  of 
metal  or  from  reflections  in  water  or  simply  from 
memory,  which  makes  of  anyone  both  a  spectator 
and  an  actor. <br>
<br>
 In  "The  Other,"  I  had  to  ensure  that 
the  speakers  were  sufficiently  different  to  be  two 
persons  and  alike  enough  to  be  one.  Is  it  worth 
stating  that  the  idea  for  the  story  came  to  me  in 
Cambridge  on  the  banks  of  the  Charles  River, 
whose  cold  course  reminded  me  of  the  far-off 
course  of  the  Rhone? <br>
<br>
The  theme  of  love  is  quite  common  in  my 
poems  but  not  in  my  prose,  which  offers  no  other example  than  "Ulrike."  The  reader  will  notice  its 
formal  affinity  with  "The  Other."
