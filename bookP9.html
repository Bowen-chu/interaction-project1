             In  spite  of  John  Felton,  Charlotte  Corday,  the 
well-known  opinion  of  Rivera  Indarte  ("It  is  a  holy 
act  to  kill  Rosas"),  and  the  Uruguayan  National 
Anthem  ("If  they  are  tyrants,  Brutus'  dagger"),  I 
do  not  approve  of  political  assassination.  Be  that  as 
it  may,  readers  of  Avelino  Arredondo's  solitary 
crime  might  wish  to  know  the  story's  outcome. 
The  historian  Luis  Melian  Lafinur  asked  for  Arredondo's pardon,  but  his  judges  Carlos  Fein  and 
Cristobal  Salvanach  sentenced  him  to  a  month  in 
solitary  confinement  and  five  years'  imprisonment. 
One  of  the  streets  of  Montevideo  now  bears  Arredondo's name.  <br>
 <br>
Two  opposite  and  inconceivable  concepts  are 
the  subjects  of  the  last  two  stories.  "The  Disk"  is 
about  the  Euclidean  circle,  which  has  only  one 
side;  "The  Book  of  Sand,"  a  volume  of  incalculable pages.  <br>
 <br>
I  hope  that  these  hasty  notes  I  have  just  dictated 
do  not  exhaust  this  book  and  that  its  dreams  go  on 
branching  out  in  the  hospitable  imagination  of 
those  who  now  close  it.  <br>
