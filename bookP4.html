                His  speculations  irritated  me. <i> "You  are  re- 
ligious, no  doubt?"</i>  I  asked  him.  <br>
 <br>
<i>"Yes,  I'm  a  Presbyterian.  My  conscience  is  clear. 
I  am  reasonably  sure  of  not  having  cheated  the  native when  I  gave  him  the  Word  of  God  in  exchange for  his  devilish  book."</i>  <br>
 <br>
I  assured  him  that  he  had  nothing  to  reproach 
himself  for,  and  I  asked  if  he  were  just  passing 
through  this  part  of  the  world.  He  replied  that  he 
planned  to  return  to  his  country  in  a  few  days.  It 
was  then  that  I  learned  that  he  was  a  Scot  from  the 
Orkney  Islands.  I  told  him  I  had  a  great  personal 
affection  for  Scotland,  through  my  love  of  Stevenson and  Hume.  <br>
 <br>
<i>"You  mean  Stevenson  and  Robbie  Burns," </i> he 
corrected.  <br>
 <br>
While  we  spoke,  I  kept  exploring  the  infinite 
book.  With  feigned  indifference,  I  asked, <i> "Do  you 
intend  to  offer  this  curiosity  to  the  British  Museum?" </i> <br>
 <br>
<i>"No.  I'm  offering  it  to  you," </i> he  said,  and  he 
stipulated  a  rather  high  sum  for  the  book.  <br>
 <br>
I  answered,  in  all  truthfulness,  that  such  a  sum 
was  out  of  my  reach,  and  I  began  thinking.  After  a 
minute  or  two,  I  came  up  with  a  scheme.  <br>
 <br>
<i>"I  propose  a  swap," </i> I  said. <i> "You  got  this  book 
for  a  handful  of  rupees  and  a  copy  of  the  Bible. 
I'll  offer  you  the  amount  of  my  pension  check, 
which  I've  just  collected,  and  my  black-letter  Wiclif 
Bible.  I  inherited  it  from  my  ancestors." </i> <br>
 <br>
<i>"A  black-letter  Wiclif!"</i>  he  murmured.  <br>
 <br>
I  went  to  my  bedroom  and  brought  him  the 
money  and  the  book.  He  turned  the  leaves  and 
studied  the  title  page  with  all  the  fervor  of  a  true 
bibliophile.
